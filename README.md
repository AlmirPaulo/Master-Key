# Master-Key

*A project by [Almir Paulo](https://almirpaulo.github.io/)*

Master Key is a password manager hosted in your own machine. With master key you can generate secure passwords to login in all apps you currently use. And you don't need to memorize all them! They are safe in a database you can access any time you want through a very intuitive interface.

## Security Issues

You gonna need to create a Master Password to access **Master Key**. This must be a strong password that you can remember (the only one, since all your other passwords will be safe in the database).

You also should backup your database once in a while in a flashdrive (or anywhere you trust), just in case you loose the data in your machine for any reason. The database is a binary file called **"passwords.db"** located in the **"Master Key"** directory.
